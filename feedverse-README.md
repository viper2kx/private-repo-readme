## Summary
<a href="https://builtwith.com/feedverse.net" target="_blank">feedverse.net Technology Profile - Builtwith.com</a> - Show off the technology I am using to create Feedverse.

#### My goals:
> 1) Privacy
> 2) Security
> 3) Simple & easy to use as possible

Right now the domain rests on a Shared Hosting server, with my business website and a couple of sites I made for friends. This plan will not support the traffic for a site of this genre.\
I've created a Donation button on PayPal to seek help with the costs,\
